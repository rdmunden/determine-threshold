                and we are working on the 3rd digit, which means there are 2 digits remaining after that
                then "d * 10**digits_remaining" is looping over:
                    190 * 100 = 19000
                    191 * 100 = 19100
                    192 * 100 = 19200
                    ...
                    199 * 100 = 19900

                To that we are adding "10**digits_remaining - 1", which in this case is 100 - 1 = 99
                So the actual numbers being tried are:
                    19099
                    19199
                    19299
